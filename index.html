          <h3>Jakub Dziarnowski</h3>
          <p> I am a student at City, University of London. I'm from Wroclaw, Poland but currently 
            I live in London. I graduated high school with the International Baccalaureate programme (IB) 
            with Mathematics, Physics and English on a higher level. In my free time, I enjoy doing sports, 
            especially lacrosse which I have been practising for the last 5 years. <br>
            <br>
            Before Bootcamp, I had a short Front-end developer course where I have 
            learned the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Although it is a bit different to Processing language, 
            I think it gave me a good base for further programming and definitely encouraged to continue programming.

          <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Hangman game</h3>
          <p align="justify">
            This is my first Processing project summarizing the 2-week Programming Bootcamp at City University (2020). 
            The program, to run properly uses multiple Processing tools like classes, loops, conditions, methods and randomness. 
            This game has the option to be played by one person or two - this can be chosen after the start of the program 
            by choosing a correct button. Choosing a singleplayer mode will randomly choose the guessing word from the 
            provided text file and start a game. Multiplayer mode will first allow you to input the word that later 
            will be guessed by another player. It is submitted by clicking enter.<br>
            When the game is played, each keypress starts the sequence of methods that determine whether the inputted 
            letter is right or wrong, and acts accordingly. If the letter is correct, the program will display it. 
            If not, then the part of the gibbet wil be drawn.<br>
            The game ends when the whole word is guessed or the whole gibbet is displayed on the screen. 
            Then the player has a choice to play again with a different word or to exit.
