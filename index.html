          <h3>Jakub Dziarnowski</h3>
          <p> I am a student at City, University oF London. I'm from Wroclaw, Poland but currently 
            I live in London. I graduated highschool with the International Baccalaureate programme (IB) 
            with math, physics and english on higher level. In my free time I enjoy doing sports, 
            especially lacrosse which I have been practicing for the last 5 years. <br>
            <br>
            Prior to bootcamp I had a showt Front-end developer course where I have learned the basics
            of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Altho it is a bit different to Processing language, I think it
            gave me a good base for futher programming and definetly encouraged to continue programming.

          <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Hangman game</h3>
          <p>
            This is my first Processing project summarizing the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
            City University (2020). Program, to run properly uses multiple Processing tools like 
            classes, loops, conditions, methods and randomness. This game has the option to be played by one person 
            or two - this can be chosen after the start of the program by chosing a correct button.
            Chosing a singleplayer mode will randomly chose the guessing word from the provided text file
            and start a game. Multiplayer mode will first allow you to input the word that later will be guessed 
            by another player. It is submitted by clicking enter. <br>
            Whent the game is played, each key press starts the sequence of methods that determin wheter the inputed letter
            is right or wrong, and acts accordingly. If the letter was correct, program displays it. If not, than the 
            part of the gibbet is drawn. <br>
            The game ends when the wole word is guessed or the whole gibbet is displayed on the screen. Then the player
            has a choice to play again with a different word of to exit.
